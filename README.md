I'm excited as this is my first Portfolio Project as a Data Analyst. In this Project, I performed Data Exploration using the covid 19 dataset which I got from the covid 19 website. 
First, I downloaded the file as csv file, filtered it and then imported the data into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, where I performed my Analysis
I explored the death cases, vaccinations, and populations. From the data I explored, I got the following findings:
--- likelyhood of dieing if anyone contracts covid in his/her country. 
--- The data exploration also shows what percentage of population got covid for a given country,example United States. 
--- I also explored countries with highest infection rate compared to their population and 
--- also Countries with highest death count per Population, 
---Death count by continent

The Covid 19 Data Set is such a big dataset that has continued to change over the years and has lots of information for anyone who actually wants to understand the impact of Covid 19 
in the world at large.
